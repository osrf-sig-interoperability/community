# OSRF Special Interest Group for Interoperability

This is the community landing page for the Open Source Robotics Foundation's Special Interest Group for Interoperability.
Our mission is to discuss and promote the objective of making robotics systems and relevant infrastructure (both software and hardware) interoperable.
Interoperable can mean components are interchangeable or it can mean different systems work together correctly and with minimal friction.
