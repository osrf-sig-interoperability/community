### Advantages of Rust for software system integration

By now you've certainly been exposed to some of the hype behind the Rust programming language.
For the last eight years Rust has [ranked #1 in the "Most admired language"](https://github.blog/2023-08-30-why-rust-is-the-most-admired-language-among-developers/#:~:text=For%20the%20eighth%20year%20in,Stack%20Overflow's%20annual%20developer%20survey.) category of Stack Overflow's annual developer survey.
Perhaps no other language in the history of software programming has commanded a following so dedicated to pestering their colleagues, friends, and random passers-by to switch to it for every conceivable use case.

At the next session of the Interoperability Special Interest Group, Grey will discuss the relevance of Rust to software system integration in particular.
The challenge of tying together complex software systems carries significant liabilities.
Failures to connect systems together correctly or to scale well can lead to cascading failures in your operations.
The Rust language and its surrounding open source ecosystem offer some unique advantages when it comes to both software correctness and scaling.

This will not be a session that teaches how to program in Rust.
The focus will be to provide attendees with enough information to objectively evaluate whether Rust is a good candidate for their business needs, with an emphasis on software system integration use cases.
We will conclude with an open Q&A, so feel free to bring along any burning questions or concerns you might have.
