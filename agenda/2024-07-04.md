### Open Mic Night

With the Fourth of July being a major holiday in the United States, the next special interest group meeting will be a (lightly moderated) open mic night. There will not be any special topic or presentation, so feel free to chat with the rest of the group about anything remotely in the sphere of interoperability.

We will not be recording this session, but I might take notes if anything particularly interesting develops from the conversations.
