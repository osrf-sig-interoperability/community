### The Challenge of Resource Contention in Large-Scale Robot Fleets

When large fleets of robots need to perform ad hoc tasks that utilize limited resources such as parking spots, (un)loading points, or chargers, operations can get messy if you don't have a way to resolve conflicts between robots that want to use the same resource at the same time.

At this session of the interoperability special interest group, Arjo Chakravarty will present on the new resource reservation system that is being introduced to Open-RMF. This new system will automatically prevent robots from attempting to use the same resource at the same time, and will also redirect robots to available parking spots where they can wait until the resource that they want becomes available.
