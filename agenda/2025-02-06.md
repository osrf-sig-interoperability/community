### Customize and configure the rmf-web dashboard with MicroApps

This month Aaron Chong will present on how to leverage the new MicroApp architecture of [rmf-web](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf-web) to make custom dashboards for fleet management.

MicroApps are React components used to customize the rmf-web dashboard. This talk will go through what MicroApps are, how they can be built, and how to integrate them with an existing rmf-web dashboard. We will also go through some of the MicroApps that already come with the rmf-dashboard-framework, and how they interact with an Open-RMF deployment.
