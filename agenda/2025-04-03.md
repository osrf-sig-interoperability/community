### Scenarios: How to manage a multiverse

The [site editor](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_site) is a tool in the Open-RMF project that allows users to sketch a facility in 3D and specify the mobile robot traffic rules within it.

A common requirement when designing the operations within a facility is the need to consider many different configurations of robots. You may want to see what happens when they are positioned differently or have different properties. You might see positive or negative impacts on the effectiveness or efficiency of your operations under the different circumstances.

A recently introduced feature to the site editor is the concept of **Scenarios** which allows users to create inter-related variations of scenarios within the same facility. Scenarios can have parent/child relationships with each other where child scenarios inherit the characteristics of parent scenarios and then introduce their own modifications. This creates branching worlds where modifications to a parent scenario will carry over into the child scenarios, while child scenarios can diverge from each other.

At this month's session, Xiyu Oh will introduce us to the scenarios feature.
