## Discussion

- Gillaume Autran worked with VDA5050 so he gave and commented how it targets AMRs with a bit of AGVs support. (Min. 40:40)
- Grey and Daniel commented on how Open-RMF, MassRobotics Interop and VDA5050 can complement each other. (Min. 41:30)
  - Grey answered follow up questions on possible collaborations (Min. 47:28)
- Grey answered what interoperability means in the context of Open-RMF and Daniel answered for MassRobotics Interop. (Min. 48:05)
- Grey and Daniel answered for network requirements for Open-RMF and MassRobotics Interop respectively. (Min. 52:00)
- Grey commented on the differences on the future event driven simulation expected for RMF vs scaling gazebo. (Min. 54:04)
- Grey commented on how to deal with fleetstate semantics for system validation. (Min. 55:23)
- Daniel asked regarding having physics turned on on simulation on a per robot level and Grey commented 
regarding the Gazebo Trivial Physics Engine and how extremely hard it would be to combine that with actual physics. (Min. 56:27)
- Daniel addressed how the VDA5050 standard efforts will correlate with MassRobotics work. (Min 59:35)
- Grey commented on the workflow on how to deploy Open-RMF, specifically how to obtain the map using the traffic editor. (Min. 60:00)
- Grey commented on possible workflows for Open-RMF when remapping environments and handling transforms. (Min: 1:07:00)
- Grey explained how the easy full control API makes easier custom actions although there are more sophisticated
ways to deal with task customization to come. (Min. 1:11:45)
- Grey addressed how Open-RMF some nodes are already robust to teardown and restart and others still need work to get there. (Min. 1:15:00)
